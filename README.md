# reviewpad-protect

[Reviewpad Protect](https://reviewpad.com/protect) is a GitHub App that allows you to configure your pull request merge rules using a simple YAML file.

It is more powerful than GitHub's native branch protection rules, and it is easier to use than GitHub's native CODEOWNERS file.

Some configuration examples are available in the [configurations](./configurations) directory.
